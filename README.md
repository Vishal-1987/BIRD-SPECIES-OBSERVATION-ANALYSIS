# AIM:
#### To monitor and assess bird populations across forest and grassland habitats with the aim of identifying species distribution, trends, and conservation priorities based on environmental conditions, observer records, and habitat types.

# QUESTIONS:
#### 1.	Temporal Analysis
#### 2.	Spatial Analysis
#### 3.	Species Analysis
#### 4.	Environmental Conditions
#### 5.	Distance and Behavior
#### 6.	Observer Trends
#### 7.	Conservation Insights

# CONCLUSION:
#### Several bird species are consistently observed at closer or farther distances, indicating varied habitat preferences or behaviors.
#### Watchlist and stewardship status highlight species that require urgent conservation attention.
#### Repeated visits to the same site increase the total number of species detected, boosting survey completeness.
#### Certain observers record more species, suggesting potential observer skill or effort differences.
#### A few AOU codes dominate the sightings, indicating high regional abundance or easier detectability of these species.
#### Insights support targeted conservation actions and more strategic resource allocation.
